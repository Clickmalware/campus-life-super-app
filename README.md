# campus-life-super-app
The purpose of this app is to help students around Grand View Campus. It has local weather, Events, dinning menus,and other useful information for students.Click the navigation bar to go to different pages, and all the links provide source material.
Future ideas 
I would be having a backend database for the meals and events, and then use APIs to connect them to the pages. 
Add a 5 day forcast to the weather page.  
I would work on getting the pages to match formats better.
I would align the pages so that they are more uniform such as a static Navigation bar.
